# vuejs-text-logger
A very simple logger plugin for Node.js and Vue.js 2.x

With this plugin you can log to a text file all the logs informations that you want as strings, line by line. It is possible to specify a file name, a file path and the maximum size of the log file. If the maximum size of the file is reached, old data will be overwritten with new ones.
